# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# Python has the following data-types built-in by default, in these categories:

# Text type : string

# Numberic types : int/float/complex

# Sequence types : list/tuple/range

# Mapping types : dictionary

# Set types: set, frozenset

# Boolean types: bool

# Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# None Type :NoneType

# x = 5
# print(type(x))
